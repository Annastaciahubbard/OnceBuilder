					<h4>DIP INTO THE DETAILS</h4>
					<p>
						Build with Twitter Bootstrap makes your site fully responsive on any new devices.
						The popular open source framework is developed around HTML5 and CSS3 techniques for constructing websites.
						You may include a series of alternate JavaScript files for advanced widgets like accordions, dropdown navigation, fixed content, and many others.
						The main advantage is precompiled code we try to use generated code instead of reading it from database.
